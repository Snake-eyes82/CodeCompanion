# Data Structures: Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries

Python offers powerful built-in data structures to organize and store collections of data.

## Lists

A **list** is an ordered, changeable collection of items. Lists are defined by enclosing elements in square brackets `[]`, separated by commas.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, "hello", True]
print(my_list)
print(my_list[0]) # Accessing elements by index (starts at 0)
my_list.append(4) # Add an element
print(my_list)
