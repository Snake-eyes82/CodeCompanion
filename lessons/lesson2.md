
# Control Structures: Variables and Data Types

In Python, a **variable** is a named storage location for a value. Think of it as a container with a label. You can put different types of data into these containers.

## Assigning Values to Variables

You use the `=` operator to assign a value to a variable.

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
height = 5.9
is_student = True
